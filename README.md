## Description
A playground for wendko's CSS Projects.
It is called "codepen" because I usually work on the projects locally first before uploading it to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

## Notes to self
- `npx pug filename.pug` will create the html file
- `npx sass style.scss style.css` will write the output to a specified CSS file.
